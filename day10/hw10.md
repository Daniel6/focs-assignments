## I. Logic

### 1.

The following tables are [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

_true_ and _false_ are represented by `T` and `F`. _OR(false, true)_ is commonly written in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation): `F OR T`.

The second table shows the value of the function _a OR b_, for all possible values _a_ and _b_. For example, _false OR true_ (the second row) has the value _true_ (the final cell of that row).

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ AND _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | F
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ OR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

a. Construct the truth table for _a XOR (b XOR a)_.

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR (_b_ XOR _a_)
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

b. Which function corresponds to the English word "or", as used in "You will eat your meat OR you can't have any pudding" (where _a_ = "You will eat your meat" and _b_ = "you can't have any pudding").

XOR
you can't eat your meat and not have any pudding, you can't not eat your meat and have pudding.

## II. Questions 2â€“6 are the same as in-class activities 2-6

### 2.

Consider the following context-free grammar G:

```
E -> E + E | T         # <- added "| T"
T -> T x T | (E) | a
```

Convert G to a PDA.

### 3.

Convert grammar G from (2) to Chomsky Normal Form.

S_0 -> E
S_1 -> T
E -> E + E | T
T -> T x T | (E) | N_0
N_0 -> a

### 4.

Is the grammar G's language a regular language? If yes, produce a FSA or regular expression for this language. If not, show this. 

G is not regular because the syntax ragarding blaancing and positioning of parentheses requires remembering previous characters of the word. While a finite automata has a finite amount of memory to remember parentheses, the language can have infinitely many parentheses.

### 5.

Theorem 1: The language {a^n b^n c^n} is not a context-free language.

a. Use Theorem 1, together with the languages {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j}, to show that the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.

Let L1 be {a^i b^i c^j}
Let L2 be {a^i b^j c^j}
both L1 and L2 are context free languages. Here are their grammars:
L1 -> XC
X -> aXb
C -> Cc

L2 -> AX
A -> aA
X -> bXc

The intersection of L1 and L2 is the language L3 = {a^i b^i c^i} which is not a context free language proven by the pumping lemma.
Thus the intersection of two context free languages is not closed under intersection.

b. Use the pumping lemma for context-free languages [Sipser pp. 125] to prove Theorem 1.

Assume that language B = {a^n b^n c^n} is a context-free language. Let p be the pumping length for B that is gauranteed to exist by the pumping lemma. Let string s = a^p b^p c^p, s is a member of B and is of at least length p. The pumping lemma states that s can be pumped, thus s can be divided into uvxyz. condition 2 of the pumping lemma states that either v or y must be non-empty. 

In the case where v and y contain only a single type of chracter (all a's, all b's or all c's), then u(v^i)x(y^i)z would contain an unequal number of a's b's and c's, and so would not be in the language B. 

In the case where v and y contain more than one type of character, u(v^i)x(y^i)z might still contain the correct number of each character, but would definitely be in the wrong order as the pattern of characters in v or y would be repeated.

Since one of these cases must be true, and both cases result in a contradiction with the pumping lemma, our assumption must be false and B must not be a context free language.

### 6.

Consider the context-free grammar G:

```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```

a. Show that the string "the girl touches the boy with the flower" has two
different leftmost derivations.

Goal: DET N V DET N P DET N

the third step is different:
S -> NP VP -> DET N VP -> DET N V NP -> DET N V NP PP -> DET N V DET N PP -> DET N V DET N P NP -> DET N V DET N P DET N
vs.
S -> NP VP -> DET N VP -> DET N VP PP -> DET N V NP PP -> DET N V DET N PP -> DET N V DET N P NP -> DET N V DET N P DET N

b. Describe in English the two different meanings of this sentence.

The girl touched the boy by touching him with the flower.
or
The girl touches the boy who is with the flower.

c. Use G to generate another ambiguous sentence.

The girl sees the boy with the binoculars.

d. Modify G so that it generates strings with adjectives: `the girl saw the tall boy`, `the girl touches the boy with a purple flower`.

add these rules:
NP -> DET A N
A -> tall | purple

You don't need to know this, but here's how the variable names relate to linguistics.

Variable | meaning
---|---
S | sentence
DET | determiner (article)
N | noun
NP | noun phrase
P | preposition
PP | prepositional phrase
V | verb
VP | verb phrase
