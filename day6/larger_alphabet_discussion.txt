If you have an alphabet of ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], it is more powerfule thana 2 letter alphabet because it has more than 2 letters. This means that every node can account for the same decision tree branches that a 2-letter alphabet can, and then an additional 2. Thus, in order to express 4 possible choices, only one node is required, whereas for the 2-lette alphabet, 3 nodes are required. Making finite state machines that use a language of 4 letters leads to more compact finite state machines that are more flexible.
